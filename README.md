The objective of this script is to graphically represent the sentiment analysis of 5 different news networks. Based on their last 100 tweets, we are trying to see how thay compare to each other. The results I recieved were interesting because some networks seemed more negative in the material they were reprting than others. Its up to you why you think they would be reporting more negative material.
